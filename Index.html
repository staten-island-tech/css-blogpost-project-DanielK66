        <p>The Taliban Watch group has just recieved these shocking Images from our afganistan coorispondents,
            showing
            what looks to be the new Afgani Navy at work. These frightening vessels can carry up to 6 armed men and
            treverse the water at up to 7 miles per hour. Its images like this that show why abandoning Afganistan
            was
            our our only option, and that a new world superpower may be rising up.</p>

        <h2>Secret Footage of Taliban Training regimine</h2>

        <p>During the fall of Kabul, many people wondered how our enemy became powerful enough to force us out of the
            region. Well, The Taliban Watch group has discovered secret footage, buerried by the main stream media, in
            order to Hide the truth. However we belived this photo was nessesary to show to the public. While we dont
            know much about it, we belive it is some sort of aincient training ritual, practiced by some of the
            strongest warriors in history. The spinning is supposed to get the body used to combat, while the horses are
            meant to simulate real battle conditions. We belive this training may have been part of the strategy that
            helped the taliban take over afganistan.</p>
